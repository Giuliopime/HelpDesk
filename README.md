### How does it work?
An #help-desk is a Discord channel where users can quickly get answers to some predefined questions or receive a role to get further assistance.  

1. You can add up to nine questions, and relative answers, to the help-desk.  
2. When users react with the corresponding question's emoji under the help desk, the bot will send a DM to the user with the answer to their question. 
3. You can add a special question which will assign the  user who queries it a certain role.
4. You can personalize the help desk message however you like (add images, text, etc...) with over 10 commands.
5. You can download the help desk settings to a local file, modify the message style & the questions/answers with a simple text-editor, and then re-upload the settings file to the bot!  
This allows you to create help-desk templates to use for any server of your choice!
